Each student must read and present to the class two to three of the assigned primary research articles throughout the term. This is an oral presentation, approximately ten minutes in length and should include a summary of the research described in the paper. Students are invited to share their own thoughts and comments regarding the study as part of a group discussion that follows the paper presentation. 

The research reports are to be presented during the lecture on the pertinent material, as outlined in the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) section.
